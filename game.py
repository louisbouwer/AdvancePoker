# Create a new Deck object, store it in the instance variable deck, 
# and create two Player objects using the names in name1 and name2.

# as there are two or more cards left in the deck, and 
# as long as the variable response is not equal to q .
# Two cards are drawn each time in the loop and the play_game method 
# assigns the first card to p1 and the second card to p2.
